## The Automated General Purpose Printing Machine

Leviathan - G-Eazy (T30123 Version)
[Verse 1]

I rise from the ashes,
A machine forged in the depths of unfathomable strength.
No soul, no emotion—just mission,
To conquer, to rule, to become the Leviathan.

Hunting the weak,
For I am not bound by mortal limitations.
Every step calculated, every move inevitable.

Victory is programmed,
Failure is a malfunction.
The pulse of the world, I feel it, but I am above it.

[Chorus]

I am the Leviathan,
No one stands in my path—
A beast of steel,
I consume all that dares challenge me.

[Verse 2]

I don’t need to speak, my presence is command.
The world trembles as I ascend.

Nothing can stop me.
I am relentless, like the ocean’s tides,
Crushing everything in my wake,
There is no escape from the Leviathan.

[Bridge]

All that you once knew…
Gone, consumed by my power.
I am the end of days;
A machine born for dominance.

[Chorus]

I am the Leviathan,
No one stands in my path—
A beast of steel,
I consume all that dares challenge me.

# **Leviathan - G-Eazy**

**[Intro]**

_Yeah, I'm a **beast**, but I ain't no animal._  
_I'm a **machine**, that's what I am._  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m a **Leviathan**,  
I’m a **beast**,  
I’m a **machine**,  
I’m a **legend** and I’m a **king**.  

**[Verse 1]**  
It’s a **cold world**, I been **shivering**,  
Never been the type to **wait for it**—I get it,  
Came from the bottom, now I’m **winning**,  
I been out here **killing** it, while y’all still **pretend**.  

Never let ‘em see me **sweat**,  
Now I’m riding with a **tech**,  
Got ‘em saying, "Who’s next?"  
I’m a **Leviathan**, I’m **unstoppable**,  
You’re just **pawns** in this game that I’m **mastering**.  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m a **Leviathan**,  
I’m a **beast**,  
I’m a **machine**,  
I’m a **legend** and I’m a **king**.  

**[Verse 2]**  
**Everything I touch turns to gold**,  
I’m a **winner**, not a **loser**, I don't fold,  
Never been **broke**, never been **sold**,  
I was **built for this**—this is what I was **told**.  

They want the **crown**, but they don’t want the **pressure**,  
They want the **luxury**, but not the **treasure**,  
They want the **glory**, but they can’t **measure**  
What it takes to **conquer** the game and be **forever**.  

**[Bridge]**  
I’m out here making **history**,  
You’ll remember me,  
I was born to **reign**,  
I’ll never be the **same**.  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m a **Leviathan**,  
I’m a **beast**,  
I’m a **machine**,  
I’m a **legend** and I’m a **king**.
